what is containerization?
  containerization is a lihgtweight virtualization technology alternative to hypervisor virtualization. 
  Any application can be bundled in a container can run without wories aboubt dependancies, libraries and binaries.
  Because container create the isolated environment with all the required dependancies, libraries and binaries to run your application without any issues. 
  Hence you can build the packages and ship the application to any enviornment and run it.
  So Containers are designed to run on physical server, virtual machines and any cloud instances.
What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is a technology that creates virtual versions of computer resources such as hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and network resources. It’s like creating a software-based replica of a physical machine, allowing you to run multiple isolated environments on the same hardware or across a distributed system.
Imagine you have a powerful computer but you only use a small portion of its resources. 
Virtualization allows you to split that computer into several virtual machines (VMs), each acting like a separate computer with its operating system and applications. 
Each virtual machine is isolated from the others, meaning issues in one virtual machine won’t affect others. 
This allows you to optimize resource utilization, run multiple applications on a single machine, and improve scalability by easily adding or removing virtual machines as needed
