 What is the difference between Head, Working Tree, and Index in Git?
Head: The Head is the parent of the next commit that is created. It is a pointer to the current branch reference and also a pointer to the last commit on the branch.
Working Tree: The working tree is where your files reside and also you can try changes before committing. It is to record the snapshots of the project.
Index: The index is a staging area between the working directory and repository. It is used to build a set of changes that you want to commit together.
