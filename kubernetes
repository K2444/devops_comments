kubernets
google is introduced kubernetes 
now maintained by CACN

cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i processor 
it will show how many cpu there
kubernetes will not recomment swap bcz it will throw error once we enable cluster.
sudo swapoff -a 
off swap in all nodes include master node till cluster enable 
free -m 
in kubernetes have one masternode and multiful workernde
masternode only give instruction to workernode
in masternode have to install ETCD, control manager, scheduler
ETCD server -----> database
     in the database all the data's are stored in key and value pair combination
control server:
   it will decide how many container have to run in workernode
  it will maintain heartbeat
if its die then it assign work to healthy node
scheduler:
it will assign the work to workernode
kubectl get ns  (namespace)
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe nodes node1(name of the node)
node-its a physical or virtual
pod--- it's a logical wrapper for a containers
container--excutable units of software in which application code is packaged along with its liabraries
kubelet--- receive info from masternode
kuberproxy: communicate between one workernode to another workernode
etc/kubernetes/manifasts have all the yaml files
